## Validation
We ran a validation study with 100 participants to determine which faces from a predetermined set were most often rated as "Middle-Eastern" and "Caucasian". 

## Research Proposal
In this cross-cultural research project, we use an experimental approach to study whether changes in the perceived prevalence of immigrants may lead to shifts in attitudes towards immigrants and immigration. Furthermore, we ask whether this effect may depend on the base rate of immigrants in a given society and whether it is modulated by demographic variables such as age and socio-economic status (SES). To investigate this question, we will use a cross-cultural experimental approach and study two representative samples of individuals in Germany and Canada. The reasoning behind the cross-cultural comparison is to study individuals in a society that has a stable migration rate and long history of immigration such as Canada as opposed to a country that has experienced a recent rise in immigration rates such as Germany.

Based on previous work (Devine et al., under review; Devine et al., sub.; Levari et al., 2018) We hypothesize that an increased prevalence of immigrants in a society leads to shifts in concept boundaries about who is judged to be an immigrant. These changes in concept spaces may have substantial implications because they may increase the social distance between immigrants and the existing population and may thereby support right-wing populistic mindsets and threaten the cohesion of a society (von Hermanni et al., 2018; Vorl√§nder et al., 2018; Zick et al., 2019).
